Final Project Report 

	Unit Testing with Sufficient Coverage: 
		I discussed that I would be using an automated testing approach in order to test the bitmap portion of my project.   
		One of the next portions of my project that I tested using unit testing was the utility capability test of the project; https://github.com/csun-comp587-s20/TensorFlow/blob/master/c_test_util.cc. This test suite is designed to test the products capability of running on a GPU and what would be the best way in which to get the device to perform the correct research on the deep neural networks. 

Automated Testing: 
	The portion of the SUT that I outlined in my project proposal that I would be testing with automated test was the bitmap portion of the SUT. The reason I had stated that I wanted to use automated testing in order to get the most coverage and in order to be able to make sure that the implementation of the bitmap was being mapped correctly.

Lessons Learned: 
	Knowing what I know now I would use Dafny to verify the project despite the extensive tests that have been done on the system. One thing that I would improve on is code maintainability and making sure that ToDoâ€™s once completed are deleted from code and just code cleanup in general making sure that everything is in the same format and is clear and easier to read.
